## Skill-Abitrator-of-Disputes
This skill is meant to allow Mycroft arbitrate silly disputes using a very basic random event. This random event simply chooses between 
two pre-parties in the dialog folder. This setup works perfectly in our household as there is just two people to arbitrate. 

In full disclosure, I'm in no way, shape, or form, someone at the moment that can further develop this skill, but I will 
try to learn as much as I can. Feel free to make the idea your own and develop it further here or elsewhere. 

## TO DO
* Add a listen event where Mycroft would request and stt a dictated summary of the dispute, and save the text to a log file, with a time stamp. 
* Add Mycroft's random decision to the log file, time stamped, and email a record to the user account (similar to the skill-dictation).
* Consider more sophisticate ways of settling disputes other than using a random event.

## Instructions
Basic MSM install. 
Simply edit the dialog files to replace names used, and that's it. 

## Examples
"Mycroft, we need you to decide an issue." 
"Mycroft, can you settle who is right on this issue."
"Mycroft, we need a decision on this issue."

## Credits
The skill is inspired and a basic reworking of Willem Ligtenberg's 'Flip a Coin' Skill.
